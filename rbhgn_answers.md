# Welcome

Welcome to this repository where you can get a first glance of collaborating on GitHub! Please answer the following questions:

# Recap

1) Why would you use a loop? Write me a for & a while loop that prints your favorite food 10 times.
To loop through Array's or to avoid repeating code.

```
for (let x = 0; x < 10; x++) {
  console.log("your favorite food");
}
```

```
let x = 0;
while (x < 10) {
  console.log("your favorite food");
  x++;
}
```

2) How do I try out whether my loop is working?

3) What are arrays? What is an ordered collection?

4) Write me an array with the names of your team and iterate over them, so all names will be printed out (using for each).

5) What is the difference between a loop and an array? Why would you use either of them?.

6) What is happening here?

```
var multiply = function(a, b) {
  return a * b;
};

multiply(2, 3)
```

7) How could we log the arguments of the code above?

8) What is ‘scope’?

9) Can I use my vars at the following places?

```
var name = Rembert

//Place A

var codaisseur = function() {
  //Place B
}
```
```
var codaisseur = function() {
  var name = Rembert
  //Place C
}

//Place D
```

10) Why would you use an object?

11) Create an object ‘teacher', that stores the name,
favorite language and a teach-function of that teacher that will alert you with some useful knowledge.

12) What are the property-names and values of the object you just created?

13) Why would you use git?

14) What is the difference between `git add`,`git commit` and `git push` ?
