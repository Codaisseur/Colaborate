    <h1>Answer Question 4 by Joyce and Pooja</h1>
        <p>Why would you want to use google fonts?</p>
        <p>• You will not have any trouble with licensing.   <br>
            • The fonts are easy to implement on your website, so no trouble with font embedding.     <br>
            • You can restrict the character set if you don’t need certain characters, which will reduce loading time.     <br>
            • Since you will not have to upload the fonts to your server, you will not experience any strain from the fonts.     <br>
            • There is quite a lot of choice for a free library.
