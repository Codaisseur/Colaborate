1) Why would you use a loop? Write me a for & a while loop that prints your favorite food 10 times.

- loops can be used to keep yout code short, organized and you can run the code as many times as you need.


let favoriteFood = "Lasagna";
let i = 0;

while (i < 11) {
  console.log(favoriteFood);
  i++;
};


// creates a for()


2) How do I try out whether my loop is working?
- you can try out your code on javascript console in your browser or in yout terminal using node command.


// my pc "broke" in the middle of the process and I couldn't answer everything =/ so just pushing what I got in order to learn pushing..
