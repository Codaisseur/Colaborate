//5 - A loop goes through a function - An array is arrangement of data
//You can use a loop to go through an array - An array is fixed and an Loop goes through is.
//6 - It's a function that multiplies  a with b. In this case we defined a= 2 and b= 3 giving the result 6
//7 -
//8 - Scope is where the variale is defined - In a funtion or outside of it.
// All of the variables outside can be used in functions but not the other way around
//9 - A B yes - C D
//10 - to give extra labels to an array set
