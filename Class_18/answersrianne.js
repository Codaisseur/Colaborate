1) to repeate a function

    var i = 0;

    while (i<10) {
      console.log('sushi')
      i++
    }

    for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      console.log("sushi")
    }

2) for instance by copying it in the concole and console.log it. Or node it in the terminal.

3) Lists/collection of a variable. An orderd collection is a collection that has a specific order in which the collection is set.

4) var team = ["Esam", "Rianne", "Jose", "Addison"];
team.forEach(function(name){
  console.log(name);
})

5)A loop runs a block of code multiple times and an array is a list or a collection of a variable. Array is a datatyp and loop is an iterator.

6) it is a function with the result 6

7) by console.log(multiply(2,3))

8) You have global scope and local scope. Scope is the 'area' you define your variables in. With a global scope, all functions can use the variable that is set glabally. If the variable is set locally within a functionblock then it can not be used in another function block.

9) yes because you can reassign the value.

10) when your variable had more details and you need to nest values

11)
    var teacher = {
      name: "Rein",
      favLang: "javascript",
      teach: function(){
        window.alert("make sure you keep breathing")
      },
    }
