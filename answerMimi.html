//1) Why would you use a loop? Write me a for & a while loop that prints your favorite food 10 times.
//To use a piece of code thats in a condition multiple times

i = 0

for(i=0; i<11; i++) {
  document.write("Pizza /n")
}

i=1
while (i<11) {
    document.write("Pizza /n")
i++
}

//2) How do I try out whether my loop is working?
run the code in tyhe browser, console..
insert a comment.log(), inside the loop and outside


//3) What are arrays? What is an ordered collection?
it is an ordered collection of elements.
an array


//4) Write me an array with the names of your team and iterate over them, so all names will be printed out (using for each).
var team = ['Bram', 'Cefe'];
  document.write (
  `Our names are ${team[0] & ${team[1]}`
  )

5) What is the difference between a loop and an array? Why would you use either of them?.
A loop runs a block of code within a condition and an array is a collection of elements..

//6) What is happening here?

var multiply = function(a, b) {
  return a * b;
};

multiply(2, 3)

The function calls the parameters a & b, which are equal to 2 & 3, and its returns its multiplication.


//7) How could we log the arguments of the code above?

console.log(multiply())

//8) What is ‘scope’?
location where you decladere a variable, localy or global

//9) Can I use my vars at the following places?

var name = Rembert

//Place A = yes

//var codaisseur = function() {
  //Place B = yes
//}

//var codaisseur = function() {
//  var name = Rembert
  //Place C =yes
//}

//Place D = no

// 10) Why would you use an object?
So you can asign multiple properties to one variable

//11) Create an object ‘teacher', that stores the name, favorite language and a teach-function of that teacher that will alert you with some useful knowledge.
var teacher = {
  name: Mimi,
  language: Dutch,
  knowledge: function(){
    alert("you have learned today!!")
  }
}  

12) What are the property-names and values of the object you just created?

13) Why would you use git?

14) What is the difference between git add,git commit and git push
